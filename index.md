Source credits goes to Professor Brailsford for sharing his invaluable knowledge with us on some Computerphile's YouTube videos.

* #### Kaskio Web Platform
Kaskio is a social file-sharing web platform. You'll be able to request files, upload them, create collections, manage the visibility of them and much more. It's social because you can unlock achievements, talk with other users and feel like you are in a big community, all of this under the best anonymity policies of the web and with clean, transparent code that will be visible to everyone. Kaskio will be something big, an insane amount of ideas are in development and I couldn't write them all  here. If you want to join in the development, you can freely send me an email! But, firstly, check if you have the right skills to work with us below!

		- You have to know these programming languages:
			- PHP
			- Hack (optional)
			- JavaScript (with jQuery)
			- HTML
			- SCSS (only for front-end developers)
		- Basic linux server management skills

* #### Tapher
Tapher is a PHP-CLI application that helps users to resolve big data tables written in ASCII and convert them into SQL statements. It's simple to use, it uses 2048kb of RAM, it also can manage big txt files (>50GB) and requires only PHP installed on your machine. Currently, it has no GUI and can only convert CSV-like ASCII tables.

### What's next?
Sometime I feel like an enlightened man with so many ideas on how to innovate our world and our being, but I don't have so much time to develop them. I'm a good dreamer and I like working in team, so you could freely request me some help on a project. You can see all my programming skills at my [about page](./about) on this site, so check it out if you want! :-)
