### What's next?
Sometime I feel like an enlightened man with so many ideas on how to innovate our world and our being, but I don't have so much time to develop them. I'm a good dreamer and I like working in team, so you could freely request me some help on a project. You can see all my programming skills at my [about page](./about) on this site, so check it out if you want! :-)
