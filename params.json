  "body": "### Hello there\r\nMy name is Giovanni Grieco (aka _corsaro_) and I'm a Computer Science and Automation Engineering student at Politecnico di Bari in Italy.\r\nPassionate about artificial intelligence and engineering R&D, I invest my time on learning new things, keep on track with exams, read books and automate my home to be more productive as possible. My personal enemy is _lazyness_, and I am in a decade-year-long romance love and war with it.\r\n\r\n### Life goals\r\nI want to work in AI development and try to create an autonomous self-sustainable machine by the end of my life, capable of understanding things and helps humans on solving the hardest problems that tackle us, like cancer, global warming, the master algorithm and, not less important, colonise the Solar System.\r\n\r\n### Programming experiences\r\nI program things since I was a little kid. I acquired a certain flexibility on languages so that I could write code without worrying about the negative impacts that could bring a certain language versus another. I love both high-level and low-level worlds of computing and I challenge myself on doing things that require both of them by breaking into OSes and customise their behaviour (_with respect of their ToS, of course!_).\r\nI prefer write code that follows the Linux programming guideline and I like sharing things under the spirit of Open Source (but not all the time).\r\n\r\n### Contacts\r\nYou can contact via [email](mailto:giovanni.grc96@gmail.com).\r\n",
